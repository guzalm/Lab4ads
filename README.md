CREATING MyHashTable class:

   STEP 1: Creating new java class with name MyHashTable
   
   STEP 2: Adding private class HashNode<>. In a hash table, each node has a key of type K, a value of type V, and a link to the next node.
   The constructor initializes the node with key and value by word 'this' and sets the null value next to it.
